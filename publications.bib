	abstract = {With initiatives such as the European Green Deal establishing more stringent environmental requirements, there is an increasing need to develop aircraft technologies and sustainable aviation practices with reduced climate impacts. Additionally, conventional environmental Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) often struggle to capture the dynamic and complex nature of aircraft operations; in particular, non-CO2 in-flight impacts, which contribute significantly to climate change, are often overlooked. In this study, we improve a discrete-event LCA approach with a climate impact evaluation model and apply it to scenario analyses comparing different aircraft designs, fuel types, and flight schedules. Our findings reveal that, contrary to previous LCA studies, the climate impact per kilometre flown increases with longer flight distances and that an efficiently planned flight schedule can reduce the overall environmental impact. The study highlights the necessity of incorporating non-CO2 effects and operational scenarios into LCA to achieve a more accurate understanding of aviation’s environmental impact.},

The method showcased allows to compare spatial distributions at a three-dimensional level, highlighting in the tape analysed a significant correspondence between regions of elevated tortuosity and increased pore fractions. Regions associated with highly tortuous meandering fibres exhibit a pronounced association with porosity located both in the bulk and at the tape surface, suggesting a strong interaction between non-collective fibre displacement and the probability of pore location. Furthermore, our study quantifies the length scale of feature propagation, shedding light on the spatial extent of microstructural pore occurrence within the composite.},

	abstract = {Understanding the microstructural variability in unidirectional composite prepreg tapes is relevant to investigating mechanisms of tape microstructure formation, their impact on its processability and the mechanical performance of the final composite part. It has been shown that three-dimensional microstructural variability at the single-fibre level can be resolved by X-ray microcomputed tomography (XCT). However, to define a representative microstructural fingerprint of a given tape, investigations at the required small voxel size lead to limited volumes of observation, which might not be representative. This research aims to extend these findings via a multiscale approach, considering scales of observations, from microscopic (single fibre) up to mesoscopic (dimension of tape) length scale, to generate further insight into the microstructural organisation of thermoplastic prepreg tapes. By exploring the ability of XCT imaging for carbon fibre-reinforced thermoplastic composites at different voxel sizes, the work aims to identify the limitations of the use of different scales of observations to capture features of microstructures and their propagation from micro- to mesoscale level. While structure tensor analysis appeared to correctly capture misaligned regions in XCT images with small voxel size (1/10 of the fibre diameter), the method proved ineffective for larger voxel size images (1/2 of the fibre diameter).},

	abstract = {Ultrasonic welding of fibre-reinforced thermoplastics is a joining technology with high potential for short welding times and low energy consumption. While the majority of the current studies on continuous ultrasonic welding have so far focused on woven reinforcements, unidirectional materials are preferred for highly loaded aerospace components due to their better mechanical performance. Therefore, this paper investigates the influence and interdependence of the welding speed, amplitude, and energy director thickness on the weld quality of adherends made of unidirectional composites. The quality of the welded joints is assessed by a single-lap shear strength and fracture surface analysis complemented by the microscopic analysis of cross-sections and comparison to a co-consolidated reference. The results showed that the welding process is highly affected by changing welding speeds for a given amplitude. Furthermore, while lower amplitudes lead to significant scatter in the welding quality, higher amplitudes result in increased heating rates and a fully molten energy director even for high welding speeds. Nevertheless, insufficient consolidation at high welding speeds results in porosity in the weld line. Finally, it was observed that thicker, and therefore more compliant, energy directors lead to more uniform melting of the energy director and less deviation in the weld quality for a wider range of welding speeds.},

A simple one-pot chemical reaction involving sustainable phenolic molecules and epichlorohydrin results in the production of renewable epoxy monomers. These monomers can be cured with amines or anhydrides to yield cross-linked thermosetting resins. Although a wide variety of recipes exist, there is a notable gap in the application of these sustainable resin formulations to engineering contexts. This gap is primarily due to the lack of comprehensive, standardized analyses of these resin recipes, which impede their potential use in advanced composite applications. In this study, we reveal a high-performance resin formulation utilizing epoxidized phloroglucinol derived from brown algae in combination with an aerospace-grade amine hardener. The resin processing and thermomechanical properties are investigated using ASTM standard tests including tensile strength, flexural strength, fracture toughness, and interlaminar shear strength. Given the detailed comparative analysis, the partially renewable resin recipe outperforms petroleum derived analogues.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on the spring-back as a function of the degree of cure on single-curved metal-composite laminates. The manufacturing through a hot-pressing process involves different (curing) stages and can reduce the spring-back with the proper combination of forming and curing. The cure-dependent spring-back is measured and analysed as a function of material constituents, fibre directions, laminate layups, and the process parameters including temperature, holding time and pressure. The results demonstrate that the spring-back ratio after full-cured process is relatively small and mainly depends on the mechanical properties of the metal sheet in laminates. However, temperature and time have a significant effect on the spring-back of partially-cured laminates and the same type of fibre prepreg combined with two different metal sheets have similar trends of spring-back reduction. Moreover, the study found that the hybrid laminates with aluminium sheet delaminate at low pressure after full-cured, while the delamination disappears as the pressure increases. The characterisation on cure-dependency of the spring-back contributes to a better understanding of the deformability of the metal-composite laminates during the hot-pressing process and offers an opportunity to tune the spring-back of these laminates.},

In this article, a method to bypass the multi-scale problem by homogenizing the micro scale and describing the medium with characteristic parameters is described. The model is intended for press molding of hybrid textiles and considers a free-form plate with non-uniform thickness and can describe consolidation in three dimensions with some restrictions. 2D implementation in FEM shows how in-plane matrix pressure gradients can arise in parts and cause fiber disorientation. Experimental verification demonstrates that fiber disorientation arises at the predicted location, and that defect size is proportional to matrix pressure gradient. This novel consolidation model provides new insights, enables part and process optimization, and paves the way for high-quality composite part production.

The study is designed to evaluate the influence of material type, inter-ply friction and clamping force by the use of a finite element modelling method. The result shows that the main failure mode for aluminium-based hybrid materials is metal cracking while prepreg buckling dominates the failure of stainless steel-based hybrid materials. The increase of clamping force contributes to the deformation of fibre reinforced prepreg layer and decrease the risk of prepreg buckling, but the simultaneous increase of plastic deformation tends to induce the failure of metal cracking. The variation of friction coefficient at the metal-prepreg interface affects the inter-ply sliding displacement during the forming process.

	abstract = {Thin-ply carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) have claimed significant attention for their potential to surpass traditional composite materials in terms of performance metrics such as first-ply damage criteria, fatigue life, and ultimate strength. This study focuses on investigating the friction behavior of dry carbon fiber tow during mechanical bar spreading, a crucial process in the manufacturing of thinply CFRP. By systematically examining the interplay of wrap angle, tow pre-tension, and final tension, insights are provided into the frictional forces exerted on the carbon fibers. The study utilizes an experimental framework to analyze single-bar and multi-bar setups, considering both symmetric and asymmetric configurations. Results reveal non-linear friction behavior, with increasing wrap angles leading to decreased dynamic friction coefficients. Additionally, results seem to suggest that higher pretension reduces internal tow movement, thereby decreasing friction losses. Multi-bar setups exhibit distinct friction profiles compared to single-bar setups, especially for larger wrap angles and asymmetric cases, indicating the influence of superimposed wrap angles on friction. Recommendations for future research include further exploration of factors such as non-uniform normal loads and relaxation distances between spreader bars to enhance modeling accuracy and optimize friction performance.},

	abstract = {The research focuses on the simultaneous deformation of uncured metal-composite laminates under the press forming process of a double-curved dome part. The study is designed to evaluate the influence of material type, inter-ply friction and clamping force by the use of a finite element modelling method. The result shows that the main failure mode for aluminium-based hybrid materials is metal cracking while prepreg buckling dominates the failure of stainless steel-based hybrid materials. The increase of clamping force contributes to the deformation of fibre reinforced prepreg layer and decrease the risk of prepreg buckling, but the simultaneous increase of plastic deformation tends to induce the failure of metal cracking. The variation of friction coefficient at the metal-prepreg interface affects the inter-ply sliding displacement during the forming process. This work provides a numerical method on the material selection and process parameter optimisation where compatible deformation of the individual layers can be achieved through its own mechanisms.},
