   abstract = {The production of advanced composites from recycled carbon fibres (rCFs) is critical for the sustainable development of carbon fibre industry. Herein, non-woven mats consisting of commingled rCFs and Polyphenylene-sulfide (PPS) fibres were compression moulded to manufacture rCF/PPS composites, with the fibre/matrix adhesion being tailored by UV-irradiating the non-woven mats. The intralaminar and interlaminar fracture resistance and mechanical performance of the rCF/PPS composites were characterised. The experimental results had demonstrated that improving the PPS/rCF adhesion of the composites significantly increased the intralaminar fracture energies and mechanical properties under tensile and shear loading conditions. However, it also negatively affected the interlaminar fracture resistance. The main fracture mechanism was observed to be fibre evulsion for the intralaminar fracture mode, while crack bridging by the rCFs was the primary fracture mechanism for the interlaminar fracture condition. That led to the contrary influences of the improved fibre/matrix adhesion on the intralaminar and interlaminar fracture resistance of the rCF/PPS composites. In summary, this study had shedded lights on tailoring the crack resistance and mechanical performance of rCFRPs by adjusting the fibre/matrix adhesion using the UV-treatment technique.},

In order to improve the energy efficiency, one needs to understand energy usage in an autoclave and factors that influence it. This work presents two thermodynamic based models for estimating energy consumption in an autoclave. The first model is an analytical approach based on simplified heat capacity equation. The second model combines the Multi-Relaxation-Time Lattice Boltzmann method (MRT LBM) with Fourier heat equation to simulate autoclave temperature flow and energy consumption. The output from the two models were compared to energy consumption data collected using a power meter. The estimated values from the MRT LBM method showed a better match with only 1% difference from the experimental value. Since the two models are parametric and scalable, a what-if analysis was carried out to investigate the influence of varying process parameters on autoclave energy consumption. Parameters including cure cycle, autoclave size and loading capacity.},

For the determination of the major mechanical properties of metals, often a uniaxial tensile test is used. Combination of these two methods for the shear deformation of hybrid metal-composite laminates is proposed comparing the method for cross-plied unidirectional prepregs and woven fabric prepregs. The effects of material constituent, shear rate, preheat temperature and normal pressure on the intra-ply shear behaviour are investigated. The results indicate that the material constituents and the frictional responses depending on processing parameters play a critical role in the shear characterisation of the hybrid laminate. The shear angle measurement at four typical strains demonstrates that the support of metal layers improves the shear deformability by delaying the onset of fibre wrinkling. This modified intra-ply shear test contributes to a better understanding of the process design for wet (uncured) hybrid metal-composite laminate manufacturing.},

Here we propose a new approach to investigate the effect of mould cavity edges on chopped tape orientation and hence the mechanical properties of CTTCs. Based on this approach, a Set Voronoi tessellation was implemented to represent the variability of local Young’s Modulus and chopped tape-cavity edge interactions occurring during the manufacturing process. It was confirmed that the chopped tapes align along the edges, and progressively transition to a random orientation towards the middle of the specimen. The results were validated on moulded specimens and demonstrated the ability to deconvolute the edge interaction.},

   journal = {ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces},
   note = {doi: 10.1021/acsami.3c10096},
   abstract = {Toughness of epoxies is commonly improved by adding thermoplastic phases, which is achieved through dissolution and phase separation at the microscale. However, little is known about the synergistic effects of toughening phases on multiple scales. Therefore, here, we study the toughening of epoxies with layered poly(ether imide) (PEI) structures at the meso- to macroscale combined with gradient morphologies at the microscale originating from reaction-induced phase separation. Characteristic features of the gradient morphology were controlled by the curing temperature (120–200 °C), while the layered macro structure originates from facile scaffold manufacturing techniques with varying poly(ether imide) layer thicknesses (50–120 μm). The fracture toughness of the modified epoxy system is investigated as a function of varying cure temperature (120–200 °C) and PEI film thickness (50–120 μm). Interestingly, the result shows that the fracture toughness of modified epoxy was mainly controlled by the macroscopic feature, being the final PEI layer thickness, i.e., film thickness remaining after partial dissolution and curing. Remarkably, as the PEI layer thickness exceeds the plastic zone around the crack tip, around 62 μm, the fracture toughness of the dual scale morphology exceeds the property of bulk PEI in addition to a 3 times increase in the property of pure epoxy. On the other hand, when the final PEI thickness was smaller than 62 μm, the fracture toughness of the modified epoxy was lower than pure PEI but still higher than pure epoxy (1.5–2 times) and “bulk toughened” system with the same volume percentage, which indicates the governing mechanism relating to microscale interphase morphology. Interestingly, decreasing the gradient microscale interphase morphology can be used to trigger an alternative failure mode with a higher crack tortuosity. By combining facile scaffold assemblies with reaction-induced phase separation, dual-scale morphologies can be tailored over a wide range, leading to intricate control of fracture mechanisms with a hybrid material exceeding the toughness of the tougher phase.},

In the methodology that was followed, we welded adherends misaligned by approximately 4.5° in different scenarios: with higher welding force; with increased ED compliance by the use of a thicker ED and; with increased ED compliance by the use of a discontinuous ED. The most significant reduction of the effects caused by misaligned adherends was obtained when combining the use of both increased welding force and discontinuous ED. Such improvement derives from the imposed parallelism caused by the use of a higher welding force and from a more efficient concentration of heat generation at the weld line that occurs when a discontinuous ED is used.},

   abstract = {Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a technique of choice for a uniform, conformal coating of substrates of complex geometries, owing to its characteristic self-limiting surface reactions upon sequential exposure to precursor vapors. In order to achieve a uniform coating, sufficient gas exposure needs to be provided. This requirement becomes particularly relevant for highly porous and high aspect-ratio substrates, where the gas transport into the substrate structure is limited by diffusion (diffusion-limited regime), or for ALD precursor systems exhibiting a low surface reaction rate (reaction-limited regime). This work reports how the distinction between diffusion- and reaction-limited ALD regimes is directly quantitatively related to the width of the reaction front and the profile of chemisorption coverage in a single-cycle ALD, all of them being determined by the natural length unit of the system. We introduce a new parametrization of the system based on its natural system of units, dictated by the scales of the physical phenomena governing the process. We present a range of scaling laws valid for a general porous substrate, which scale intuitively with the natural units of the system. The scaling laws describe (i) the coating depth in a diffusion-limited regime with respect to the gas exposure, (ii) the chemisorption coverage in a reaction-limited regime with respect to the gas exposure, and (iii) the width of the reaction zone in the diffusion-limited regime. For the first time, the distinction between diffusion- and reaction-limited ALD regimes is directly quantitatively related to the width of the reaction zone and the profile of chemisorption coverage in a single-cycle ALD. The model system for the multicycle diffusion-limited coating of random fibrous mats was validated with an experiment of ALD on a forest of tortuous carbon nanotubes.},

   abstract = {Exploring routes for the effective use of recycled carbon fibres (rCFs) is critical to close the loop in the life cycle of carbon fibres. This work demonstrated a potential of using rCFs for interlayer toughening of carbon fibre/epoxy composites. Nonwoven mats based on rCFs and commingled rCFs/Polyphenylene-sulfid (PPS) fibres were used to interlay a laminate, aiming to improve the mode-I and mode-II fracture toughness. The experimental results proved significant enhancements in the interlaminar fracture properties upon interleaving, with the rCF/PPS mats exhibiting a more prominent toughening effectiveness than the rCF mats. For example, the maximum increase in mode-I and mode-II fracture initiation energies of the laminates was 51% and 66%, respectively upon interleaving the rCF mats, and 220% and 105%, respectively by adding the rCFs/PPS mats. The fractography analysis proved that the main toughening mechanisms were fibre debonding and pulling-out for the rCF mats and fibre bridging for the commingled rCFs/PPS mats. The differences in the toughening mechanisms resulted in opposite effects of the interlayer/epoxy adhesion to the fracture toughness, i.e. an improved interlayer/epoxy adhesion increased the toughening effectiveness of the rCF mats, but negatively affected the toughening performance of the rCF/PPS mats.},

Different angles were created by changing the clamping configuration. The results showed that increasing the angle between adherends decreases the power consumed and increases the process time while decreasing the weld uniformity and increasing the risk of overheating. These effects were associated to the impact of the different clamping configurations on the cyclic strain in the energy director and adherends during the welding process. Decreasing the top adherends bending stiffness by increasing the clamping distance was found to significantly reduce the adverse effects of adherend misalignment on weld quality.},

The aim was to identify aspects of the test method critical to obtain reliable results and to arrive at a recommended test procedure for fibre bed compaction measurements. A glass fibre 2/2 twill weave and a biaxial (±45°) glass fibre non-crimp fabric (NCF) were tested in dry and wet conditions. All participants used the same testing procedure but were allowed to use the testing frame, the fixture and sample geometry of their choice. The results showed a large scatter in the maximum compaction stress between participants at the given target thickness, with coefficients of variation ranging from 38% to 58%. Statistical analysis of data indicated that wetting of the specimen significantly affected the scatter in results for the woven fabric, but not for the NCF. This is related to the fibre mobility in the architectures in both fabrics. As isolating the effect of other test parameters on the results was not possible, no statistically significant effect of other test parameters could be proven. The high sensitivity of the recorded compaction pressure near the minimum specimen thickness to changes in specimen thickness suggests that small uncertainties in thickness can result in large variations in the maximum value of the compaction stress. Hence, it is suspected that the thickness measurement technique used may have an effect on the scatter.},

While current studies are mostly limited to fabric materials the applicability to unidirectional materials, as found in aerospace structures, would offer opportunities for joining primary aircraft structures. However, due to the highly anisotropic flow of a molten unidirectional ply undesired squeeze flow phenomena can occur at the edges of the weld overlap. This paper investigates how the fibre orientation in the plies adjacent to the weld line influences the welding process and the appearance of edge defects. Ultrasonic welding experiments with different layups and energy director configurations were carried out while monitoring temperatures at different locations inside and outside the weld overlap. The joints were characterized by single lap shear tests, analysis of corresponding fracture surfaces and microscopic cross-sections. Results showed that the anisotropic flow and the anisotropic thermal conductivity of the plies adjacent to the weld line have a distinct effect on the appearance and location of edge defects. By using energy directors that cover only part of the weld overlap area a new approach was developed to mitigate edge defects caused by the highly directional properties of the unidirectional plies.},

   abstract = {Understanding the three-dimensional variability of unidirectional composites is relevant to the material performance and the development of advanced material modelling strategies. This work proposes a new methodology for the characterization of unidirectional composites, showcased on carbon fibre/poly(ether-ether-ketone) tapes. Three microstructural descriptors were here introduced, each representing an increasing level of complexity in the fibre architecture: from a tortuosity-based single fibre trajectory analysis to fibre groups’ behaviour, to fibre network interconnectivity. The methodology was developed and validated on real material datasets acquired via X-ray computed tomography. A facile method for image analysis was used to reconstruct the three-dimensional fibrous architecture at a single fibre path resolution. The approach bridges a gap in the traditional approach and nomenclature typical of the composite field to describe and quantify complex fibre organization in unidirectional composites, highlighting micro- and mesoscopic features, such as edge-core effects in the fibre arrangement, possibly occurring in tow spreading. The study of the parameter interdependence showed relationships, which will provide further insight for future research in the study of microstructure formation of unidirectional composites, its evolution during processing or loading, and input for advanced modelling techniques based on Representative Volume Elements.},

   abstract = {Epoxies are inherently brittle materials and to overcome this brittleness, a second microphase (i.e., thermoplastic) is typically added. This modification of epoxy resin using thermoplastics results in reaction-induced phase separating morphologies in the micrometer range. In this study, the influence of the curing history, beyond phase separation, on the interphase formation and final morphology of PEI and the high Tg epoxy system is investigated. Several cure cycles were examined, each with a first dwell temperature ranging from 120 to 180 °C for a given time up to the onset of phase separation (OPS) or up to the 80% degree of cure (80% DOC) and then with a second dwell at 200 °C for 20 min to complete the cure cycle. Hot-stage microscopy experiments were carried out at several first dwell temperatures before final conversion at the second dwell. The morphologies and resulting droplet size distribution at the interphase, after the final cure, were analyzed through scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that the diffusion distance was significantly higher in the case of OPS as compared to the 80% DOC case, particularly at lower first dwell temperatures. This behavior was attributed to the fact that, in the case of OPS, polymeric chains were still in a mobile state and diffused further during the second dwell curing stage, while at 80% DOC, polymeric chains were completely bound but still diffuse due to non-stoichiometric curing. This restricted mobility of polymeric chains after phase separation (80% DOC) resulted in a larger number of smaller droplets as compared to the OPS case.},

To assess the influence of TCR numerically, a three-dimensional optical-thermal model was developed. Experimental results indicated that, for the same tape temperature near the nip point, an increase in the compaction force resulted in a decrease in the temperature at the roller exit and the following cooling phase, in correlation with an increase in the final DIC. Also, the effect of the laser power on the final DIC was less pronounced than the compaction force. In the thermal model, when TCR at the tape-substrate interface was not considered, the temperature predictions underestimated the experimental measurements.},

Thermoplastic tapes were heated above the melting temperature with different heated lengths (30 and 80 mm and heating times (0.2 and 0.8 s) in a dedicated experimental setup. In-situ and ex-situ characterization techniques were used to observe the differences between the micro- and meso- structure of the tape before and after heating. The experiments resulted in significant changes in the tape structure, namely increased out-of-plane deformation, waviness, arc-length width, roughness, thickness and volumetric void content. This study shows for the first time that a unique deconsolidation behavior takes place during the heating phase of LAFP: the deconsolidation mechanisms are exacerbated by the non-uniform temperature at the tape surface, which is caused by roughness increase and waviness formation.},

Knudsen's theory can be straightforwardly applied to filter membranes with arrays of extended holes for example, however, for the inverse geometry arrangement, which arises when solid nanowires or fibers are arranged into porous interwoven material (like in carpets or brushes) the derivation of an analytical theory framework was still missing. In this paper, we have identified the specific geometric and thermodynamic parameters that determine the gas diffusion kinetics in arrays of randomly oriented cylinders and provide a set of analytical expressions allowing to comprehensively describe the gas transport in such structures. We confirmed analytical solutions by Monte Carlo simulations. We specify our findings for an atomic layer deposition process, the diffusion of trimethyaluminium molecules into a carbon nanotube array, but highlight the applicability of our derivation for other fields comprising gas diffusion membranes, composite materials, fuel cells and more.},

   abstract = {Epoxy resins are widely used for different commercial applications, particularly in the aerospace industry as matrix carbon fibre reinforced polymers composite. This is due to their excellent properties, i.e., ease of processing, low cost, superior mechanical, thermal and electrical properties. However, a pure epoxy system possesses some inherent shortcomings, such as brittleness and low elongation after cure, limiting performance of the composite. Several approaches to toughen epoxy systems have been explored, of which formation of the interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) has gained increasing attention. This methodology usually results in better mechanical properties (e.g., fracture toughness) of the modified epoxy system. Ideally, IPNs result in a synergistic combination of desirable properties of two different polymers, i.e., improved toughness comes from the toughener while thermosets are responsible for high service temperature. Three main parameters influence the mechanical response of IPN toughened systems: (i) the chemical structure of the constituents, (ii) the toughener content and finally and (iii) the type and scale of the resulting morphology. Various synthesis routes exist for the creation of IPN giving different means of control of the IPN structure and also offering different processing routes for making composites. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art on toughening of epoxy matrix system through formation of IPN structure, either by using thermoplastics or thermosets. Moreover, the potential of IPN based epoxy systems is explored for the formation of composites particularly for aerospace applications.},

The concept of effective intimate contact, which is based on the resin content at the surface, is introduced and a methodology to measure it from surface micrographs is provided. Degree of effective intimate contact measured from the samples was compared with the existing intimate contact models. The temperature history in the compaction zone was estimated with a finite element model and pressure sensitive films were used to determine the compaction pressure. It is shown that in addition to the squeeze flow mechanism, which is the base for the current intimate contact models, through-thickness percolation flow of the resin needs to be considered to explain the effective intimate contact development.},

Through better impregnation, the modified CP matrix composites showed an increase in stiffness and strength of ∼10% and 20%, respectively, in comparison to unmodified CP matrix composites. The impact properties also increased by up to 28%, showing that modified CP is a credible matrix for realising sustainable all-cellulose natural fibre composites with high stiffness, strength and toughness.},

   abstract = {Abstract Reinforced polymer-based composites are attractive lightweight materials for aircrafts, automobiles, and turbine blades, but still show strength and fracture toughness lower than traditional metals. An interesting approach to address this issue is to fabricate composites with structural features that absorb part of the elastic energy stored in the material during fracture through extrinsic and intrinsic toughening mechanisms behind and ahead of the crack tip, respectively. Inspired by the nacreous layer of mollusk shells, the fracture behavior of multiscale composites that combine intrinsic toughness from a brick-and-mortar structure connected through nanoscale mineral bridges and extrinsic toughness arising from a brittle–ductile laminate architecture at the millimeter scale are fabricated and investigated. Such a hierarchical toughening approach increases the dissipated energy by more than 30-fold during fracture with minimal loss in stiffness and strength. Using simple energy balance arguments and fracture mechanics concepts, guidelines are established for the design of nacre-like composites with a remarkable combination of stiffness, strength, and toughness. This demonstrates the possibility to controllably introduce toughening mechanisms at different length scales and to thus fabricate hierarchical composites with high fracture resistance in spite of the brittle nature of their main inorganic constituents.},

Further, we suggest strategies for how the composites can be re-used or decomposed at the end-of-life cycle. Closed-mold densification has the advantage that no elaborate lab equipment is needed. Simple screw clamps or a press can be used for densification. We recommend this method for small parts with simple geometries and large radii of curvature. Vacuum densification in an open-mold process is suitable for larger objects and complex geometries, including small radii of curvature. Compared to the closed-mold process, the open-mold vacuum approach only needs the manufacture of a single mold cavity.},

Using linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) – polyamide 6 (PA6) filaments with a diameter of approximately 100 μm, it has been shown that the addition of 2–5 weight % maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene (MAPE) significantly increases the surface energy of LLDPE, which results in substantial improvements in the mean interfacial shear strength and work to debond. Use of 10 % wt. MAPE leads to the formation of voids which are detrimental to the mechanical properties of the core – sheath interface, despite a further enhancement of surface energy.},

Using this methodology, polymer surfaces are studied in solid state, however, during spreading of polymers on a substrate, polymers are in molten state and at high temperature, having different surface energies and more complex polymer/substrate interactions due to polymer chain mobility. This paper presents a model study with practical relevance to predict polymer/substrate compatibility including contact angle measurements at high temperature directly performed between molten thermoplastics; polypropylene (PP), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and maleic anhydride-grafted polypropylene (MAPP), on smooth glass fibres and plates. The values of total surface energy of thermoplastics at high temperature (260 °C) are down to 57% of that measured at room temperature, which has a strong influence on the wetting prediction. Surface energies of both the polymer and the substrate were found not to be the only factor controlling the wetting behaviour of molten polymers and the level of adhesion with the substrate, but also some intrinsic characteristics of the polymer melt play a role. We also observed that the wetting behaviour of molten MAPP is affected by the maleic anhydride (MA) content, demonstrating dramatically different results to room temperature measurements, which is suspected to be due to the formation of covalent bonds of MA groups with the glass surface enhancing the interface strength beyond the shear strength of MAPP.},

   journal = {Carbon},
   volume = {115},

   abstract = {Composite materials based on carbon fiber (CF) are prone to failure at the fiber-matrix interface upon compression or stress transverse to the fiber axis. The direct growth of carbon nanotubes on CF constitutes a novel approach to enhance the mechanical properties of the interface. However, the challenge is that, during the growth, tensile properties of the fiber are altered due to the diffusion effect of iron nanoparticles used in the process, leading to CF surface defect formation. In this work, we deliver and discuss an analysis methodology on ptychographic X-ray computed tomography (PXCT) images in order to assess the iron nanoparticle abundance within CFs. PXCT provides 50 nm - resolved 3D electron density maps of the CFs. We evidence the protective effect of an ultrathin alumina film against iron infiltration into CF during the CNT growth. This method potentially allows to evaluate the efficiency of other diffusion-minimizing approaches. The conclusions of the PXCT examination are validated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy carried out on thin sample slices cut with a focused ion beam. The results provide a new insight into the mechanical performance of CFs and therefore constitute valuable knowledge for the development of hierarchical composites.},

   abstract = {The damping behaviour of continuous carbon fibre and flax fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP and FFRP) composites was studied by comparing angle-ply laminates. Using logarithmic decrement measurements, dynamic mechanical analysis and vibration beam measurements, the damping was described as the specific damping capacity ψ in order to compare data using the different methods. Our results show approximately 2–3 times better damping of FFRP compared to CFRP at low frequency and low strain. We show that the damping of both materials increases with increasing angle-ply orientation below 300 Hz . While the matrix and interface seems to contribute mainly to damping at lower frequencies, the fibre shows an increasing contribution with ψ =  64.4 % for unidirectional FFRP at 1259 Hz in the 5 t h mode of vibration, without a notable change in the elastic modulus. This work demonstrates that the FFRP may be simultaneously stiff and efficient at damping.},

   abstract = {To simultaneously address the lower toughness and the build-up of internal heat for fast-curing epoxy matrices, the influence of nominal 100 nm and 300 nm core-shell rubber (CSR) particles on the properties and rheo-kinetics were studied. The fracture energy was enhanced by a factor of 14.5, up to 2572 ± 84 J m−2 with 14.5 wt% of the nominal 300 nm diameter CSR particles, with evidence of cavitation and plastic void growth of the rubber core combined with shear band yielding of the epoxy matrix. These toughening mechanisms were modelled with an approximately linear increase up to 10 wt% for both particle types. At higher concentrations, deviation between the measured and modelled data was observed due to insufficient epoxy to dissipate additional energy. The CSR particles were not filtered out or damaged during the manufacturing of composites and reduced the total heat of reaction with a linear correlation, demonstrating a multi-functionality of simultaneous toughening and reduction of the exothermic peak.},

   abstract = {The rheological properties of epoxy matrices and adhesives during cure are modelled in this work. Three epoxy-amine systems, designed for different applications with distinct curing behaviours, were investigated. Curing times ranged from a few seconds to upwards of 220 min depending on the cure temperature and formulation of the epoxy. The presented time-dependent model adds an exponential fit to Kiuna-Fontana's master curve of dimensionless viscosity, as well as a weighting function for the overall fit, aiming at creating a more accurate model. A major benefit of the approach is that time consuming determination of the cure kinetics using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is not required. The developed model was also used to predict the viscosity of a typical, non-isothermal curing cycle for composite manufacturing. It proved to correlate well with both isothermal and non-isothermal processes, demonstrating that it is particularly useful model to describe viscosity for flow modelling or process optimisation.},

Our results show that by using the analytical model, one may precisely describe the cure reaction and join the composites without any additional adhesive. The co-cured composites were successfully manufactured with stable fibre volume fractions and glass transition temperatures between the two sub-components. Additionally, merits of the process, such as modifying reinforcing areas locally, or formation of net shape detail are discussed.},

This study aims to address new practical ways to recycle CFRP materials. CFRP materials with a polyether ether ketone (PEEK) matrix were fragmented via electrodynamical fragmentation, which exhibits several benefits compared to mechanical shredding processes, especially for composites commonly found in the aerospace industry. The fragments are characterized and reused to produce new CFRP aerospace parts. Structural testing of recycled composite parts revealed a 17% decrease of the mechanical properties compared to the novel material. The combination of these manufacturing and recycling techniques closes the cradle to cradle loop of thermoplastic CFRP.},
