   abstract = {Utilization of sustainable feedstocks to fabricate renewable thermosetting epoxy resins has been of great interest recently; however, their translation into composite structures and benchmark comparisons are poorly understood. Phloroglucinol is a phenolic molecule obtained from brown algae, and its epoxidized form is a high viscosity, high reactivity monomer. In this study, the potential of epoxidized phloroglucinol as a laminating resin was examined in comparison with a bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) epoxy monomer employing the Epikure 04908 linear amine hardener system. Utilization of a reactive diluent for PHTE resin was necessary for room temperature laminating applications to reduce viscosity, and the thermomechanical properties of PHTE-based resins and composites are superior to those of BADGE systems.},

   abstract = {A new model is proposed for the consolidation of hybrid textiles, in which air entrapment and dissolution are considered. One of the key parameters is tow permeability, which is described by the analytical model of Gebart and validated at very high fibre volume fractions by direct tow permeability measurement. The model also takes into account the presence of fibres limiting gas diffusion in the molten polymer. Experimental validation of the proposed model is then conducted with quasi-unidirectional glass textile and either polypropylene or polyethylene by measuring the impregnation degree as a function of the consolidation time. Good agreement is found between predictions and measurements for the two matrix systems at different pressures. It is shown that entrapped air significantly influences impregnation. The model offers new and comprehensive insights about the phenomena taking place during consolidation and enables future process optimization.},
