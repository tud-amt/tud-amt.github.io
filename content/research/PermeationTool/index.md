This tool has been developed to clarify and explain the physical phenomena of permeation.

On this [*web page*](/permeation_tool/Permeation_Tool.html), you'll find :

 - Explanations, definitions and animations of this phenomena,
 - A tool to determine the permeation coefficient (permeability) from experimental data,
 - A unit converter to convert all the differents units you can find in paper about permeability,
 - A tool to see the evolution of the permeate flow in cases of cracks, or not.
 - A glossary and some usefuls ressources and references.
