abstract: The end of life of carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) structures represents
  a major challenge to the aerospace industry, as new European regulations are demanding
  recycling solutions that can be complicated and expensive to apply. This study aims
  to address new practical ways to recycle CFRP materials. CFRP materials with a polyether
  ether ketone (PEEK) matrix were fragmented via electrodynamical fragmentation, which
  exhibits several benefits compared to mechanical shredding processes, especially
  for composites commonly found in the aerospace industry. The fragments are characterized
  and reused to produce new CFRP aerospace parts. Structural testing of recycled composite
  parts revealed a 17% decrease of the mechanical properties compared to the novel
  material. The combination of these manufacturing and recycling techniques closes
  the cradle to cradle loop of thermoplastic CFRP.
