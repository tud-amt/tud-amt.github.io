abstract: This study focuses on the spring-back as a function of the degree of cure
  on single-curved metal-composite laminates. The manufacturing through a hot-pressing
  process involves different (curing) stages and can reduce the spring-back with the
  proper combination of forming and curing. The cure-dependent spring-back is measured
  and analysed as a function of material constituents, fibre directions, laminate
  layups, and the process parameters including temperature, holding time and pressure.
  The results demonstrate that the spring-back ratio after full-cured process is relatively
  small and mainly depends on the mechanical properties of the metal sheet in laminates.
  However, temperature and time have a significant effect on the spring-back of partially-cured
  laminates and the same type of fibre prepreg combined with two different metal sheets
  have similar trends of spring-back reduction. Moreover, the study found that the
  hybrid laminates with aluminium sheet delaminate at low pressure after full-cured,
  while the delamination disappears as the pressure increases. The characterisation
  on cure-dependency of the spring-back contributes to a better understanding of the
  deformability of the metal-composite laminates during the hot-pressing process and
  offers an opportunity to tune the spring-back of these laminates.
