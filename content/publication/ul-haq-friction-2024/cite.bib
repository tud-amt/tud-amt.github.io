 abstract = {Thin-ply carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) have claimed significant attention for their potential to surpass traditional composite materials in terms of performance metrics such as first-ply damage criteria, fatigue life, and ultimate strength. This study focuses on investigating the friction behavior of dry carbon fiber tow during mechanical bar spreading, a crucial process in the manufacturing of thinply CFRP. By systematically examining the interplay of wrap angle, tow pre-tension, and final tension, insights are provided into the frictional forces exerted on the carbon fibers. The study utilizes an experimental framework to analyze single-bar and multi-bar setups, considering both symmetric and asymmetric configurations. Results reveal non-linear friction behavior, with increasing wrap angles leading to decreased dynamic friction coefficients. Additionally, results seem to suggest that higher pretension reduces internal tow movement, thereby decreasing friction losses. Multi-bar setups exhibit distinct friction profiles compared to single-bar setups, especially for larger wrap angles and asymmetric cases, indicating the influence of superimposed wrap angles on friction. Recommendations for future research include further exploration of factors such as non-uniform normal loads and relaxation distances between spreader bars to enhance modeling accuracy and optimize friction performance.},
