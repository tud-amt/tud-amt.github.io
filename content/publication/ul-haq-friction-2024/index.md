abstract: Thin-ply carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) have claimed significant
  attention for their potential to surpass traditional composite materials in terms
  of performance metrics such as first-ply damage criteria, fatigue life, and ultimate
  strength. This study focuses on investigating the friction behavior of dry carbon
  fiber tow during mechanical bar spreading, a crucial process in the manufacturing
  of thinply CFRP. By systematically examining the interplay of wrap angle, tow pre-tension,
  and final tension, insights are provided into the frictional forces exerted on the
  carbon fibers. The study utilizes an experimental framework to analyze single-bar
  and multi-bar setups, considering both symmetric and asymmetric configurations.
  Results reveal non-linear friction behavior, with increasing wrap angles leading
  to decreased dynamic friction coefficients. Additionally, results seem to suggest
  that higher pretension reduces internal tow movement, thereby decreasing friction
  losses. Multi-bar setups exhibit distinct friction profiles compared to single-bar
  setups, especially for larger wrap angles and asymmetric cases, indicating the influence
  of superimposed wrap angles on friction. Recommendations for future research include
  further exploration of factors such as non-uniform normal loads and relaxation distances
  between spreader bars to enhance modeling accuracy and optimize friction performance.
