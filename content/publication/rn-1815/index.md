abstract: Toughness of epoxies is commonly improved by adding thermoplastic phases,
  which is achieved through dissolution and phase separation at the microscale. However,
  little is known about the synergistic effects of toughening phases on multiple scales.
  Therefore, here, we study the toughening of epoxies with layered poly(ether imide)
  (PEI) structures at the meso- to macroscale combined with gradient morphologies
  at the microscale originating from reaction-induced phase separation. Characteristic
  features of the gradient morphology were controlled by the curing temperature (120–200
  °C), while the layered macro structure originates from facile scaffold manufacturing
  techniques with varying poly(ether imide) layer thicknesses (50–120 μm). The fracture
  toughness of the modified epoxy system is investigated as a function of varying
  cure temperature (120–200 °C) and PEI film thickness (50–120 μm). Interestingly,
  the result shows that the fracture toughness of modified epoxy was mainly controlled
  by the macroscopic feature, being the final PEI layer thickness, i.e., film thickness
  remaining after partial dissolution and curing. Remarkably, as the PEI layer thickness
  exceeds the plastic zone around the crack tip, around 62 μm, the fracture toughness
  of the dual scale morphology exceeds the property of bulk PEI in addition to a 3
  times increase in the property of pure epoxy. On the other hand, when the final
  PEI thickness was smaller than 62 μm, the fracture toughness of the modified epoxy
  was lower than pure PEI but still higher than pure epoxy (1.5–2 times) and “bulk
  toughened” system with the same volume percentage, which indicates the governing
  mechanism relating to microscale interphase morphology. Interestingly, decreasing
  the gradient microscale interphase morphology can be used to trigger an alternative
  failure mode with a higher crack tortuosity. By combining facile scaffold assemblies
  with reaction-induced phase separation, dual-scale morphologies can be tailored
  over a wide range, leading to intricate control of fracture mechanisms with a hybrid
  material exceeding the toughness of the tougher phase.
