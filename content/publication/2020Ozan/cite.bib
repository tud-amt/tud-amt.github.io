 abstract = {Intimate contact development under LAFP-specific thermal and mechanical boundary conditions/interactions and the effect of process parameters are investigated. One-layer, unidirectional strips of CF/PEKK material were placed with different process parameters on a flat tool surface to create different intimate contact conditions. The concept of effective intimate contact, which is based on the resin content at the surface, is introduced and a methodology to measure it from surface micrographs is provided. Degree of effective intimate contact measured from the samples was compared with the existing intimate contact models. The temperature history in the compaction zone was estimated with a finite element model and pressure sensitive films were used to determine the compaction pressure. It is shown that in addition to the squeeze flow mechanism, which is the base for the current intimate contact models, through-thickness percolation flow of the resin needs to be considered to explain the effective intimate contact development.},
