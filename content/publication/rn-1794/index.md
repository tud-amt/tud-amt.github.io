abstract: Ultrasonic welding is a promising joining technique for thermoplastic composite
  parts. On the way towards upscaling and industrialisation of this technology, it
  is crucial to understanding how it is affected by manufacturing tolerances. The
  objective of the research presented in this paper was to investigate the influence
  that misaligned adherends have on static ultrasonic welding of thermoplastic composites.
  Different angles were created by changing the clamping configuration. The results
  showed that increasing the angle between adherends decreases the power consumed
  and increases the process time while decreasing the weld uniformity and increasing
  the risk of overheating. These effects were associated to the impact of the different
  clamping configurations on the cyclic strain in the energy director and adherends
  during the welding process. Decreasing the top adherends bending stiffness by increasing
  the clamping distance was found to significantly reduce the adverse effects of adherend
  misalignment on weld quality.
