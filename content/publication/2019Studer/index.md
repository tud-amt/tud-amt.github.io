abstract: To reduce the cycle time of structural, automotive thermoplastic composites,
  we investigated the potential of direct thermoplastic melt impregnation of glass
  fabrics using an injection moulding process. At the high pressures that occur during
  the process, the effect of the fabric architecture on the impregnation, compaction,
  volume fraction and permeability of two unidirectional fabrics was studied. Using
  impregnation experiments with a low viscosity PA6 melt, we identified a favourable
  processing window resulting in an impregnation time of 5â€¯min. The impregnation experiments
  with thermoplastic melts demonstrate that textile architectures promoting dual scale
  flow during impregnation are favourable for complete filling. Based on our findings,
  thermoplastic compression resin transfer moulding is an efficient processing route
  for automated production of composite parts with a high fibre volume fraction, if
  the fabric architecture is adapted for higher processing pressures and by fully
  utilising dual scale flow.
