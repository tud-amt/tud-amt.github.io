 abstract = {The development of epoxy resin formulations from renewable feedstocks has been thoroughly explored in the chemical literature. A simple one-pot chemical reaction involving sustainable phenolic molecules and epichlorohydrin results in the production of renewable epoxy monomers. These monomers can be cured with amines or anhydrides to yield cross-linked thermosetting resins. Although a wide variety of recipes exist, there is a notable gap in the application of these sustainable resin formulations to engineering contexts. This gap is primarily due to the lack of comprehensive, standardized analyses of these resin recipes, which impede their potential use in advanced composite applications. In this study, we reveal a high-performance resin formulation utilizing epoxidized phloroglucinol derived from brown algae in combination with an aerospace-grade amine hardener. The resin processing and thermomechanical properties are investigated using ASTM standard tests including tensile strength, flexural strength, fracture toughness, and interlaminar shear strength. Given the detailed comparative analysis, the partially renewable resin recipe outperforms petroleum derived analogues.},
