abstract: The production of advanced composites from recycled carbon fibres (rCFs)
  is critical for the sustainable development of carbon fibre industry. Herein, non-woven
  mats consisting of commingled rCFs and Polyphenylene-sulfide (PPS) fibres were compression
  moulded to manufacture rCF/PPS composites, with the fibre/matrix adhesion being
  tailored by UV-irradiating the non-woven mats. The intralaminar and interlaminar
  fracture resistance and mechanical performance of the rCF/PPS composites were characterised.
  The experimental results had demonstrated that improving the PPS/rCF adhesion of
  the composites significantly increased the intralaminar fracture energies and mechanical
  properties under tensile and shear loading conditions. However, it also negatively
  affected the interlaminar fracture resistance. The main fracture mechanism was observed
  to be fibre evulsion for the intralaminar fracture mode, while crack bridging by
  the rCFs was the primary fracture mechanism for the interlaminar fracture condition.
  That led to the contrary influences of the improved fibre/matrix adhesion on the
  intralaminar and interlaminar fracture resistance of the rCF/PPS composites. In
  summary, this study had shedded lights on tailoring the crack resistance and mechanical
  performance of rCFRPs by adjusting the fibre/matrix adhesion using the UV-treatment
  technique.
