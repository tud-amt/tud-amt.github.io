abstract: The effect of thermal contact resistance (TCR) correlated to the degree
  of intimate contact (DIC) between the incoming tape and the substrate on the temperature
  history during laser-assisted fiber placement (LAFP) was investigated. A novel experimental
  methodology was designed to understand the effect with a non-contact method which
  did not influence the local consolidation quality. To assess the influence of TCR
  numerically, a three-dimensional optical-thermal model was developed. Experimental
  results indicated that, for the same tape temperature near the nip point, an increase
  in the compaction force resulted in a decrease in the temperature at the roller
  exit and the following cooling phase, in correlation with an increase in the final
  DIC. Also, the effect of the laser power on the final DIC was less pronounced than
  the compaction force. In the thermal model, when TCR at the tape-substrate interface
  was not considered, the temperature predictions underestimated the experimental
  measurements.
