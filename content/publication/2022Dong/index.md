abstract: Exploring routes for the effective use of recycled carbon fibres (rCFs)
  is critical to close the loop in the life cycle of carbon fibres. This work demonstrated
  a potential of using rCFs for interlayer toughening of carbon fibre/epoxy composites.
  Nonwoven mats based on rCFs and commingled rCFs/Polyphenylene-sulfid (PPS) fibres
  were used to interlay a laminate, aiming to improve the mode-I and mode-II fracture
  toughness. The experimental results proved significant enhancements in the interlaminar
  fracture properties upon interleaving, with the rCF/PPS mats exhibiting a more prominent
  toughening effectiveness than the rCF mats. For example, the maximum increase in
  mode-I and mode-II fracture initiation energies of the laminates was 51% and 66%,
  respectively upon interleaving the rCF mats, and 220% and 105%, respectively by
  adding the rCFs/PPS mats. The fractography analysis proved that the main toughening
  mechanisms were fibre debonding and pulling-out for the rCF mats and fibre bridging
  for the commingled rCFs/PPS mats. The differences in the toughening mechanisms resulted
  in opposite effects of the interlayer/epoxy adhesion to the fracture toughness,
  i.e. an improved interlayer/epoxy adhesion increased the toughening effectiveness
  of the rCF mats, but negatively affected the toughening performance of the rCF/PPS
  mats.
