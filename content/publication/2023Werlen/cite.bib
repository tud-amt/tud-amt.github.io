 abstract = {A new model is proposed for the consolidation of hybrid textiles, in which air entrapment and dissolution are considered. One of the key parameters is tow permeability, which is described by the analytical model of Gebart and validated at very high fibre volume fractions by direct tow permeability measurement. The model also takes into account the presence of fibres limiting gas diffusion in the molten polymer. Experimental validation of the proposed model is then conducted with quasi-unidirectional glass textile and either polypropylene or polyethylene by measuring the impregnation degree as a function of the consolidation time. Good agreement is found between predictions and measurements for the two matrix systems at different pressures. It is shown that entrapped air significantly influences impregnation. The model offers new and comprehensive insights about the phenomena taking place during consolidation and enables future process optimization.},
