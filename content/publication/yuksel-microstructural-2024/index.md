abstract: This study presents the first steps of a benchmarking exercise on image
  processing of composite materials. Employing three distinct imaging protocols and
  five different image processing algorithms, the research explains the variability
  in capturing microstructural features of common micrograph dataset. Results highlight
  the sensitivity of different methods to factors like illumination inhomogeneities
  and pixel density, influencing the accuracy and consistency of obtained results.
  By comparing methodologies from different researchers in a blind format, the study
  identifies strengths and limitations, laying the groundwork for future benchmarking
  activities. Moving forward, this research sets the stage for standardized protocols
  and guidelines, aiming to enhance the reproducibility and reliability of microstructural
  analysis in composite materials. Such efforts are crucial for advancing material
  design and development, ultimately creating tailored composite materials with enhanced
  performance and functionality.
