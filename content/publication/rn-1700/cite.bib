 abstract = {Passive spanwise bending shape-adaption has the potential to increase the efficiency and manoeuvrability of vehicles with wing-like structures. By utilisation of compression flange buckling, the in-plane stiffness can be tuned to design beams with contrasting pre-buckling and post-buckling bending stiffness. The investigated concept is experimentally validated using a thin-ply laminated composite four-point bending beam, which is designed to experience compression flange buckling in the span with constant moment. The bending stiffness was reduced by more than 41% after the onset of buckling which shows the effectiveness of compression flange buckling for non-linear bending compliance.},
