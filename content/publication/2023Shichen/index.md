abstract: The bias-extension test is one of the test methods to characterise the intra-ply
  shear behaviour of continuous fibre reinforced composites including fabrics and
  unidirectional (UD) materials. For the determination of the major mechanical properties
  of metals, often a uniaxial tensile test is used. Combination of these two methods
  for the shear deformation of hybrid metal-composite laminates is proposed comparing
  the method for cross-plied unidirectional prepregs and woven fabric prepregs. The
  effects of material constituent, shear rate, preheat temperature and normal pressure
  on the intra-ply shear behaviour are investigated. The results indicate that the
  material constituents and the frictional responses depending on processing parameters
  play a critical role in the shear characterisation of the hybrid laminate. The shear
  angle measurement at four typical strains demonstrates that the support of metal
  layers improves the shear deformability by delaying the onset of fibre wrinkling.
  This modified intra-ply shear test contributes to a better understanding of the
  process design for wet (uncured) hybrid metal-composite laminate manufacturing.
