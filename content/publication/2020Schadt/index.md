abstract: Passive spanwise bending shape-adaption has the potential to increase the
  efficiency and manoeuvrability of vehicles with wing-like structures. By utilisation
  of compression flange buckling, the in-plane stiffness can be tuned to design beams
  with contrasting pre-buckling and post-buckling bending stiffness. The investigated
  concept is experimentally validated using a thin-ply laminated composite four-point
  bending beam, which is designed to experience compression flange buckling in the
  span with constant moment. The bending stiffness was reduced by more than 41% after
  the onset of buckling which shows the effectiveness of compression flange buckling
  for non-linear bending compliance.
