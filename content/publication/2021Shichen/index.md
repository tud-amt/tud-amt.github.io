abstract: Forming process with pre-stacked and uncured thermoset fibre metal laminate
  offers improved deformability compared to full-cured laminate especially for the
  production of complex structural components. This work investigated the friction
  behaviour at the metal-prepreg interface of glass fibre reinforced aluminium laminate
  through an inter-ply friction test. The influence of sliding velocity, normal force,
  fibre orientation and resin viscosity coupled with temperature on static and kinetic
  friction coefficients were studied. The kinetic friction behavior in the transition
  region between mixed and hydrodynamic lubrication, showed a good agreement with
  the Stribeck-curve theory. While for the static friction, a modified Coulomb friction
  model was found to fit the experimental results. These models were translated into
  a phenomenological inter-ply friction model which was incorporated into Abaqus/Explicit
  as a user-defined friction subroutine for verification. The findings contribute
  to the development of the forming process with fibre metal laminates.
