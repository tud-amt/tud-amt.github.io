abstract: Delignified densified wood is a new promising and sustainable material that
  possesses the potential to replace synthetic materials, such as glass fiber reinforced
  composites, due to its excellent mechanical properties. Delignified wood, however,
  is rather fragile in a wet state, which makes handling and shaping challenging.
  Here we present two fabrication processes, closed-mold densification and vacuum
  densification, to produce high-performance cellulose composites based on delignified
  wood, including an assessment of their advantages and limitations. Further, we suggest
  strategies for how the composites can be re-used or decomposed at the end-of-life
  cycle. Closed-mold densification has the advantage that no elaborate lab equipment
  is needed. Simple screw clamps or a press can be used for densification. We recommend
  this method for small parts with simple geometries and large radii of curvature.
  Vacuum densification in an open-mold process is suitable for larger objects and
  complex geometries, including small radii of curvature. Compared to the closed-mold
  process, the open-mold vacuum approach only needs the manufacture of a single mold
  cavity.
