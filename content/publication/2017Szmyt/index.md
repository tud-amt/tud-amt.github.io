abstract: Composite materials based on carbon fiber (CF) are prone to failure at the
  fiber-matrix interface upon compression or stress transverse to the fiber axis.
  The direct growth of carbon nanotubes on CF constitutes a novel approach to enhance
  the mechanical properties of the interface. However, the challenge is that, during
  the growth, tensile properties of the fiber are altered due to the diffusion effect
  of iron nanoparticles used in the process, leading to CF surface defect formation.
  In this work, we deliver and discuss an analysis methodology on ptychographic X-ray
  computed tomography (PXCT) images in order to assess the iron nanoparticle abundance
  within CFs. PXCT provides 50Â nm - resolved 3D electron density maps of the CFs.
  We evidence the protective effect of an ultrathin alumina film against iron infiltration
  into CF during the CNT growth. This method potentially allows to evaluate the efficiency
  of other diffusion-minimizing approaches. The conclusions of the PXCT examination
  are validated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and scanning transmission
  electron microscopy carried out on thin sample slices cut with a focused ion beam.
  The results provide a new insight into the mechanical performance of CFs and therefore
  constitute valuable knowledge for the development of hierarchical composites.
