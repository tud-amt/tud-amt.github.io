abstract: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a technique of choice for a uniform, conformal
  coating of substrates of complex geometries, owing to its characteristic self-limiting
  surface reactions upon sequential exposure to precursor vapors. In order to achieve
  a uniform coating, sufficient gas exposure needs to be provided. This requirement
  becomes particularly relevant for highly porous and high aspect-ratio substrates,
  where the gas transport into the substrate structure is limited by diffusion (diffusion-limited
  regime), or for ALD precursor systems exhibiting a low surface reaction rate (reaction-limited
  regime). This work reports how the distinction between diffusion- and reaction-limited
  ALD regimes is directly quantitatively related to the width of the reaction front
  and the profile of chemisorption coverage in a single-cycle ALD, all of them being
  determined by the natural length unit of the system. We introduce a new parametrization
  of the system based on its natural system of units, dictated by the scales of the
  physical phenomena governing the process. We present a range of scaling laws valid
  for a general porous substrate, which scale intuitively with the natural units of
  the system. The scaling laws describe (i) the coating depth in a diffusion-limited
  regime with respect to the gas exposure, (ii) the chemisorption coverage in a reaction-limited
  regime with respect to the gas exposure, and (iii) the width of the reaction zone
  in the diffusion-limited regime. For the first time, the distinction between diffusion-
  and reaction-limited ALD regimes is directly quantitatively related to the width
  of the reaction zone and the profile of chemisorption coverage in a single-cycle
  ALD. The model system for the multicycle diffusion-limited coating of random fibrous
  mats was validated with an experiment of ALD on a forest of tortuous carbon nanotubes.
