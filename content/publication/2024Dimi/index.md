abstract: Utilization of sustainable feedstocks to fabricate renewable thermosetting
  epoxy resins has been of great interest recently; however, their translation into
  composite structures and benchmark comparisons are poorly understood. Phloroglucinol
  is a phenolic molecule obtained from brown algae, and its epoxidized form is a high
  viscosity, high reactivity monomer. In this study, the potential of epoxidized phloroglucinol
  as a laminating resin was examined in comparison with a bisphenol A diglycidyl ether
  (BADGE) epoxy monomer employing the Epikure 04908 linear amine hardener system.
  Utilization of a reactive diluent for PHTE resin was necessary for room temperature
  laminating applications to reduce viscosity, and the thermomechanical properties
  of PHTE-based resins and composites are superior to those of BADGE systems.
