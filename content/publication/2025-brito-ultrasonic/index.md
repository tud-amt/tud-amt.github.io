abstract: Our aim with this work was to evaluate how the thermoplastic resin used
  in the composite adherends and on the energy director affected the static ultrasonic
  welding process in both parallel and misaligned configurations. Polyetheretherketone
  (PEEK) and low-melt polyaryletherketone (LMPAEK) were the resins used and their
  thermomechanical properties were characterized via dynamic-mechanical analysis and
  modulated differential scanning calorimetry. With parallel adherends, neither the
  welding time nor the through-thickness heating in the adherends vary significantly.
  This similarity was attributed to a larger heat capacity of the PEEK energy director
  counterbalancing its higher viscoelastic heating rate. With misaligned adherends,
  the welding time was larger for PEEK welds than for LMPAEK welds and LMPAEK adherends
  presented a larger though-thickness heating. These effects were attributed to the
  larger bulk viscoelastic heating rate of carbon fibre reinforced/LMPAEK adherends
  adding up to the lower heat capacity of LMPAEK.
