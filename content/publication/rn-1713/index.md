abstract: This paper reports the results of an international benchmark exercise on
  the measurement of fibre bed compaction behaviour. The aim was to identify aspects
  of the test method critical to obtain reliable results and to arrive at a recommended
  test procedure for fibre bed compaction measurements. A glass fibre 2/2 twill weave
  and a biaxial (±45°) glass fibre non-crimp fabric (NCF) were tested in dry and wet
  conditions. All participants used the same testing procedure but were allowed to
  use the testing frame, the fixture and sample geometry of their choice. The results
  showed a large scatter in the maximum compaction stress between participants at
  the given target thickness, with coefficients of variation ranging from 38% to 58%.
  Statistical analysis of data indicated that wetting of the specimen significantly
  affected the scatter in results for the woven fabric, but not for the NCF. This
  is related to the fibre mobility in the architectures in both fabrics. As isolating
  the effect of other test parameters on the results was not possible, no statistically
  significant effect of other test parameters could be proven. The high sensitivity
  of the recorded compaction pressure near the minimum specimen thickness to changes
  in specimen thickness suggests that small uncertainties in thickness can result
  in large variations in the maximum value of the compaction stress. Hence, it is
  suspected that the thickness measurement technique used may have an effect on the
  scatter.
