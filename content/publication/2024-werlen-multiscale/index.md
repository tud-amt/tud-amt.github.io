abstract: Modeling the consolidation of fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites
  at the part level presents a formidable computational challenge due to the multi-scale
  nature of the process. In this article, a method to bypass the multi-scale problem
  by homogenizing the micro scale and describing the medium with characteristic parameters
  is described. The model is intended for press molding of hybrid textiles and considers
  a free-form plate with non-uniform thickness and can describe consolidation in three
  dimensions with some restrictions. 2D implementation in FEM shows how in-plane matrix
  pressure gradients can arise in parts and cause fiber disorientation. Experimental
  verification demonstrates that fiber disorientation arises at the predicted location,
  and that defect size is proportional to matrix pressure gradient. This novel consolidation
  model provides new insights, enables part and process optimization, and paves the
  way for high-quality composite part production. Highlights A consolidation model
  for press molding of hybrid textiles is presented. A method to extend consolidation
  models for complex geometry is presented. The origin of defect formation in complex
  geometries is explained.
