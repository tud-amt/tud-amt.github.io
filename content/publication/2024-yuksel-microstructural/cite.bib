 abstract = {This study presents the first steps of a benchmarking exercise on image processing of composite materials. Employing three distinct imaging protocols and five different image processing algorithms, the research explains the variability in capturing microstructural features of common micrograph dataset. Results highlight the sensitivity of different methods to factors like illumination inhomogeneities and pixel density, influencing the accuracy and consistency of obtained results. By comparing methodologies from different researchers in a blind format, the study identifies strengths and limitations, laying the groundwork for future benchmarking activities. Moving forward, this research sets the stage for standardized protocols and guidelines, aiming to enhance the reproducibility and reliability of microstructural analysis in composite materials. Such efforts are crucial for advancing material design and development, ultimately creating tailored composite materials with enhanced performance and functionality.},
