 abstract = {The objective of this paper was to develop cure kinetic models to describe the B-stage curing and co-curing assembly of carbon fibre reinforced thermosetting polymer (CFRP) composites. Starting from the analytical model, temperature cycles and experimental procedures are developed to join a B-stage CFRP part to a reinforcing B-stage CFRP patch for local reinforcement. Our results show that by using the analytical model, one may precisely describe the cure reaction and join the composites without any additional adhesive. The co-cured composites were successfully manufactured with stable fibre volume fractions and glass transition temperatures between the two sub-components. Additionally, merits of the process, such as modifying reinforcing areas locally, or formation of net shape detail are discussed.},
