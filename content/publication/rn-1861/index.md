abstract: Chopped Tape Thermoplastic Composites (CTTCs) offer high formability and
  performance for complex-shaped components in the aerospace and automotive industries.
  However, the mesoscopic discontinuity leads to spatial variabilities and correspondingly
  high scatter in the elastic properties of CTTCs due to the random orientations of
  chopped tapes and chopped tape-cavity edge interactions. Here we propose a new approach
  to investigate the effect of mould cavity edges on chopped tape orientation and
  hence the mechanical properties of CTTCs. Based on this approach, a Set Voronoi
  tessellation was implemented to represent the variability of local Youngâ€™s Modulus
  and chopped tape-cavity edge interactions occurring during the manufacturing process.
  It was confirmed that the chopped tapes align along the edges, and progressively
  transition to a random orientation towards the middle of the specimen. The results
  were validated on moulded specimens and demonstrated the ability to deconvolute
  the edge interaction.
