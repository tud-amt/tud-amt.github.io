abstract: Understanding the microstructural variability in unidirectional composite
  prepreg tapes is relevant to investigating mechanisms of tape microstructure formation,
  their impact on its processability and the mechanical performance of the final composite
  part. It has been shown that three-dimensional microstructural variability at the
  single-fibre level can be resolved by X-ray microcomputed tomography (XCT). However,
  to define a representative microstructural fingerprint of a given tape, investigations
  at the required small voxel size lead to limited volumes of observation, which might
  not be representative. This research aims to extend these findings via a multiscale
  approach, considering scales of observations, from microscopic (single fibre) up
  to mesoscopic (dimension of tape) length scale, to generate further insight into
  the microstructural organisation of thermoplastic prepreg tapes. By exploring the
  ability of XCT imaging for carbon fibre-reinforced thermoplastic composites at different
  voxel sizes, the work aims to identify the limitations of the use of different scales
  of observations to capture features of microstructures and their propagation from
  micro- to mesoscale level. While structure tensor analysis appeared to correctly
  capture misaligned regions in XCT images with small voxel size (1/10 of the fibre
  diameter), the method proved ineffective for larger voxel size images (1/2 of the
  fibre diameter).
