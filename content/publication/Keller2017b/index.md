abstract: Abstract Reinforced polymer-based composites are attractive lightweight
  materials for aircrafts, automobiles, and turbine blades, but still show strength
  and fracture toughness lower than traditional metals. An interesting approach to
  address this issue is to fabricate composites with structural features that absorb
  part of the elastic energy stored in the material during fracture through extrinsic
  and intrinsic toughening mechanisms behind and ahead of the crack tip, respectively.
  Inspired by the nacreous layer of mollusk shells, the fracture behavior of multiscale
  composites that combine intrinsic toughness from a brick-and-mortar structure connected
  through nanoscale mineral bridges and extrinsic toughness arising from a brittle–ductile
  laminate architecture at the millimeter scale are fabricated and investigated. Such
  a hierarchical toughening approach increases the dissipated energy by more than
  30-fold during fracture with minimal loss in stiffness and strength. Using simple
  energy balance arguments and fracture mechanics concepts, guidelines are established
  for the design of nacre-like composites with a remarkable combination of stiffness,
  strength, and toughness. This demonstrates the possibility to controllably introduce
  toughening mechanisms at different length scales and to thus fabricate hierarchical
  composites with high fracture resistance in spite of the brittle nature of their
  main inorganic constituents.
