abstract: With initiatives such as the European Green Deal establishing more stringent
  environmental requirements, there is an increasing need to develop aircraft technologies
  and sustainable aviation practices with reduced climate impacts. Additionally, conventional
  environmental Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) often struggle to capture the dynamic
  and complex nature of aircraft operations; in particular, non-CO2 in-flight impacts,
  which contribute significantly to climate change, are often overlooked. In this
  study, we improve a discrete-event LCA approach with a climate impact evaluation
  model and apply it to scenario analyses comparing different aircraft designs, fuel
  types, and flight schedules. Our findings reveal that, contrary to previous LCA
  studies, the climate impact per kilometre flown increases with longer flight distances
  and that an efficiently planned flight schedule can reduce the overall environmental
  impact. The study highlights the necessity of incorporating non-CO2 effects and
  operational scenarios into LCA to achieve a more accurate understanding of aviation’s
  environmental impact.
