abstract: 'Epoxy resins are widely used for different commercial applications, particularly
  in the aerospace industry as matrix carbon fibre reinforced polymers composite.
  This is due to their excellent properties, i.e., ease of processing, low cost, superior
  mechanical, thermal and electrical properties. However, a pure epoxy system possesses
  some inherent shortcomings, such as brittleness and low elongation after cure, limiting
  performance of the composite. Several approaches to toughen epoxy systems have been
  explored, of which formation of the interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) has gained
  increasing attention. This methodology usually results in better mechanical properties
  (e.g., fracture toughness) of the modified epoxy system. Ideally, IPNs result in
  a synergistic combination of desirable properties of two different polymers, i.e.,
  improved toughness comes from the toughener while thermosets are responsible for
  high service temperature. Three main parameters influence the mechanical response
  of IPN toughened systems: (i) the chemical structure of the constituents, (ii) the
  toughener content and finally and (iii) the type and scale of the resulting morphology.
  Various synthesis routes exist for the creation of IPN giving different means of
  control of the IPN structure and also offering different processing routes for making
  composites. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art
  on toughening of epoxy matrix system through formation of IPN structure, either
  by using thermoplastics or thermosets. Moreover, the potential of IPN based epoxy
  systems is explored for the formation of composites particularly for aerospace applications.'
