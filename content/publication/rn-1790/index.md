abstract: The rheological properties of epoxy matrices and adhesives during cure are
  modelled in this work. Three epoxy-amine systems, designed for different applications
  with distinct curing behaviours, were investigated. Curing times ranged from a few
  seconds to upwards of 220Â min depending on the cure temperature and formulation
  of the epoxy. The presented time-dependent model adds an exponential fit to Kiuna-Fontana's
  master curve of dimensionless viscosity, as well as a weighting function for the
  overall fit, aiming at creating a more accurate model. A major benefit of the approach
  is that time consuming determination of the cure kinetics using differential scanning
  calorimetry (DSC) is not required. The developed model was also used to predict
  the viscosity of a typical, non-isothermal curing cycle for composite manufacturing.
  It proved to correlate well with both isothermal and non-isothermal processes, demonstrating
  that it is particularly useful model to describe viscosity for flow modelling or
  process optimisation.
