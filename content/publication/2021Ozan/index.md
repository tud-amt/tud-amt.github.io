abstract: 'In this study, the effect of rapid laser heating, which is typical during
  laser-assisted fiber placement (LAFP), on the micro- and meso- structure of the
  thermoplastic tape was investigated. Thermoplastic tapes were heated above the melting
  temperature with different heated lengths (30 and 80 mm and heating times (0.2 and
  0.8 s) in a dedicated experimental setup. In-situ and ex-situ characterization techniques
  were used to observe the differences between the micro- and meso- structure of the
  tape before and after heating. The experiments resulted in significant changes in
  the tape structure, namely increased out-of-plane deformation, waviness, arc-length
  width, roughness, thickness and volumetric void content. This study shows for the
  first time that a unique deconsolidation behavior takes place during the heating
  phase of LAFP: the deconsolidation mechanisms are exacerbated by the non-uniform
  temperature at the tape surface, which is caused by roughness increase and waviness
  formation.'
