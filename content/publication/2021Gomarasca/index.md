abstract: 'Understanding the three-dimensional variability of unidirectional composites
  is relevant to the material performance and the development of advanced material
  modelling strategies. This work proposes a new methodology for the characterization
  of unidirectional composites, showcased on carbon fibre/poly(ether-ether-ketone)
  tapes. Three microstructural descriptors were here introduced, each representing
  an increasing level of complexity in the fibre architecture: from a tortuosity-based
  single fibre trajectory analysis to fibre groupsâ€™ behaviour, to fibre network interconnectivity.
  The methodology was developed and validated on real material datasets acquired via
  X-ray computed tomography. A facile method for image analysis was used to reconstruct
  the three-dimensional fibrous architecture at a single fibre path resolution. The
  approach bridges a gap in the traditional approach and nomenclature typical of the
  composite field to describe and quantify complex fibre organization in unidirectional
  composites, highlighting micro- and mesoscopic features, such as edge-core effects
  in the fibre arrangement, possibly occurring in tow spreading. The study of the
  parameter interdependence showed relationships, which will provide further insight
  for future research in the study of microstructure formation of unidirectional composites,
  its evolution during processing or loading, and input for advanced modelling techniques
  based on Representative Volume Elements.'
