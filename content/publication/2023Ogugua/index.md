abstract: Autoclave curing is one of the most energy consuming processes in manufacturing
  carbon fibre reinforced polymers. In order to improve the energy efficiency, one
  needs to understand energy usage in an autoclave and factors that influence it.
  This work presents two thermodynamic based models for estimating energy consumption
  in an autoclave. The first model is an analytical approach based on simplified heat
  capacity equation. The second model combines the Multi-Relaxation-Time Lattice Boltzmann
  method (MRT LBM) with Fourier heat equation to simulate autoclave temperature flow
  and energy consumption. The output from the two models were compared to energy consumption
  data collected using a power meter. The estimated values from the MRT LBM method
  showed a better match with only 1% difference from the experimental value. Since
  the two models are parametric and scalable, a what-if analysis was carried out to
  investigate the influence of varying process parameters on autoclave energy consumption.
  Parameters including cure cycle, autoclave size and loading capacity.
