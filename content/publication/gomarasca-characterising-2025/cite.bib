 abstract = {This work proposes a methodology for the characterisation of complex pore features in unidirectional composite prepregs, and provides insights into the interaction between fibre architecture and pores. The method showcased allows to compare spatial distributions at a three-dimensional level, highlighting in the tape analysed a significant correspondence between regions of elevated tortuosity and increased pore fractions. Regions associated with highly tortuous meandering fibres exhibit a pronounced association with porosity located both in the bulk and at the tape surface, suggesting a strong interaction between non-collective fibre displacement and the probability of pore location. Furthermore, our study quantifies the length scale of feature propagation, shedding light on the spatial extent of microstructural pore occurrence within the composite.},
