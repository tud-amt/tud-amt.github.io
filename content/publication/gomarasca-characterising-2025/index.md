abstract: This work proposes a methodology for the characterisation of complex pore
  features in unidirectional composite prepregs, and provides insights into the interaction
  between fibre architecture and pores. The method showcased allows to compare spatial
  distributions at a three-dimensional level, highlighting in the tape analysed a
  significant correspondence between regions of elevated tortuosity and increased
  pore fractions. Regions associated with highly tortuous meandering fibres exhibit
  a pronounced association with porosity located both in the bulk and at the tape
  surface, suggesting a strong interaction between non-collective fibre displacement
  and the probability of pore location. Furthermore, our study quantifies the length
  scale of feature propagation, shedding light on the spatial extent of microstructural
  pore occurrence within the composite.
