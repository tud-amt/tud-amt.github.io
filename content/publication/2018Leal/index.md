abstract: The core – sheath interfacial interactions in a bicomponent thermoplastic
  filament have been analyzed by means of an adapted micro-mechanical approach for
  interfacial pull-out. The method relies on a specimen preparation procedure that
  selectively removes a segment of the sheath component while leaving the core intact.
  This adaptation of the classical pull-out method enables the controlled extraction
  of the exposed core from the embedded bicomponent segment. Using linear low density
  polyethylene (LLDPE) – polyamide 6 (PA6) filaments with a diameter of approximately
  100 μm, it has been shown that the addition of 2–5 weight % maleic anhydride grafted
  polyethylene (MAPE) significantly increases the surface energy of LLDPE, which results
  in substantial improvements in the mean interfacial shear strength and work to debond.
  Use of 10 % wt. MAPE leads to the formation of voids which are detrimental to the
  mechanical properties of the core – sheath interface, despite a further enhancement
  of surface energy.
