abstract: To simultaneously address the lower toughness and the build-up of internal
  heat for fast-curing epoxy matrices, the influence of nominal 100 nm and 300 nm
  core-shell rubber (CSR) particles on the properties and rheo-kinetics were studied.
  The fracture energy was enhanced by a factor of 14.5, up to 2572 ± 84 J m−2 with
  14.5 wt% of the nominal 300 nm diameter CSR particles, with evidence of cavitation
  and plastic void growth of the rubber core combined with shear band yielding of
  the epoxy matrix. These toughening mechanisms were modelled with an approximately
  linear increase up to 10 wt% for both particle types. At higher concentrations,
  deviation between the measured and modelled data was observed due to insufficient
  epoxy to dissipate additional energy. The CSR particles were not filtered out or
  damaged during the manufacturing of composites and reduced the total heat of reaction
  with a linear correlation, demonstrating a multi-functionality of simultaneous toughening
  and reduction of the exothermic peak.
