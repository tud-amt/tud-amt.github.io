abstract: The objective of this paper was to develop cure kinetic models to describe
  the B-stage curing and co-curing assembly of carbon fibre reinforced thermosetting
  polymer (CFRP) composites. Starting from the analytical model, temperature cycles
  and experimental procedures are developed to join a B-stage CFRP part to a reinforcing
  B-stage CFRP patch for local reinforcement. Our results show that by using the analytical
  model, one may precisely describe the cure reaction and join the composites without
  any additional adhesive. The co-cured composites were successfully manufactured
  with stable fibre volume fractions and glass transition temperatures between the
  two sub-components. Additionally, merits of the process, such as modifying reinforcing
  areas locally, or formation of net shape detail are discussed.
