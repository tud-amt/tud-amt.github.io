abstract: The effect of ply thickness on the notch sensitivity and bearing properties
  on carbon fibre reinforced polymer composites and their hybrid laminates with steel
  foils were studied. Laminates with ply thicknesses of 0.3 mm and 0.03 mm comprising
  of CFRP and hybrid laminates were manufactured and characterized using tension,
  open hole tension and double lap bearing tests. A 25% ply substitution was found
  to double the bearing load with extensive plastic deformation in the joint while
  maintaining high stress and maintaining constant cross-sectional thickness in the
  laminate. With a good agreement between the finite element predicted values and
  failure behaviour, the damage initiation and progression behaviour could be observed
  experimentally. We numerically captured (i) rapid failure of 0° plies in the thin
  ply CFRP hybrid and (ii) continuous delamination with significant plastic deformation
  for the thick ply CFRP hybrid. The numerical results significantly reduce future
  experimental work when designing hybrid laminates and could allow the laminate lay-up
  to be tailored for load cases. Both the experiments and numerical models underline
  the distinct size effects occurring with respect to the ply thicknesses when hybridising
  a very ductile metal with a brittle yet strong composite material.
