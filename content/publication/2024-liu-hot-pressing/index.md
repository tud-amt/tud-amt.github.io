abstract: The research focuses on the simultaneous deformation of uncured metal-composite
  laminates under the press forming process of a double-curved dome part. The study
  is designed to evaluate the influence of material type, inter-ply friction and clamping
  force by the use of a finite element modelling method. The result shows that the
  main failure mode for aluminium-based hybrid materials is metal cracking while prepreg
  buckling dominates the failure of stainless steel-based hybrid materials. The increase
  of clamping force contributes to the deformation of fibre reinforced prepreg layer
  and decrease the risk of prepreg buckling, but the simultaneous increase of plastic
  deformation tends to induce the failure of metal cracking. The variation of friction
  coefficient at the metal-prepreg interface affects the inter-ply sliding displacement
  during the forming process. This work provides a numerical method on the material
  selection and process parameter optimisation where compatible deformation of the
  individual layers can be achieved through its own mechanisms.
