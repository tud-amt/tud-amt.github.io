abstract: In the collaborative effort towards standardisation of out-of-plane permeability
  measurement, an international benchmarking exercise was carried out whereby 19 participants
  worldwide were instructed to measure the outof-plane permeability following a number
  of strict guidelines, informed by the outcomes of the first international benchmarking
  exercise completed in 2021. This paper presents the results of the exercise and
  an assessment of the reproducibility of the data and the suitability of the proposed
  test method. The data returned were subjected to a number of statistical analysis
  methods, which showed that adherence to the test guidelines resulted in a high likelihood
  of a participant not being an outlier and therefore providing evidence that the
  test method proposed in this paper is a suitable way forward for a standardised
  test method.
