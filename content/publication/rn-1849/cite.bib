 abstract = {The production of advanced composites from recycled carbon fibres (rCFs) is critical for the sustainable development of carbon fibre industry. Herein, non-woven mats consisting of commingled rCFs and Polyphenylene-sulfide (PPS) fibres were compression moulded to manufacture rCF/PPS composites, with the fibre/matrix adhesion being tailored by UV-irradiating the non-woven mats. The intralaminar and interlaminar fracture resistance and mechanical performance of the rCF/PPS composites were characterised. The experimental results had demonstrated that improving the PPS/rCF adhesion of the composites significantly increased the intralaminar fracture energies and mechanical properties under tensile and shear loading conditions. However, it also negatively affected the interlaminar fracture resistance. The main fracture mechanism was observed to be fibre evulsion for the intralaminar fracture mode, while crack bridging by the rCFs was the primary fracture mechanism for the interlaminar fracture condition. That led to the contrary influences of the improved fibre/matrix adhesion on the intralaminar and interlaminar fracture resistance of the rCF/PPS composites. In summary, this study had shedded lights on tailoring the crack resistance and mechanical performance of rCFRPs by adjusting the fibre/matrix adhesion using the UV-treatment technique.},
