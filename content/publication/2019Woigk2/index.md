abstract: Natural materials such as wood exhibit high mechanical properties through
  cellulose structured at multiple length scales and embedded in a matrix of similar
  chemical structure. These hierarchical materials have inspired the design of lightweight
  composites composed of naturally occurring polymers. However, the close proximity
  of melt and decomposition temperature remain a challenge. In this work, cellulose
  propionate (CP) is modified to reduce its glass transition temperature and melt
  viscosity, allowing its use as a matrix in a natural fibre-reinforced composite.
  Through better impregnation, the modified CP matrix composites showed an increase
  in stiffness and strength of âˆ¼10% and 20%, respectively, in comparison to unmodified
  CP matrix composites. The impact properties also increased by up to 28%, showing
  that modified CP is a credible matrix for realising sustainable all-cellulose natural
  fibre composites with high stiffness, strength and toughness.
