abstract: Ultrasonic welding is a promising technology to join fibre-reinforced thermoplastic
  composites. While current studies are mostly limited to fabric materials the applicability
  to unidirectional materials, as found in aerospace structures, would offer opportunities
  for joining primary aircraft structures. However, due to the highly anisotropic
  flow of a molten unidirectional ply undesired squeeze flow phenomena can occur at
  the edges of the weld overlap. This paper investigates how the fibre orientation
  in the plies adjacent to the weld line influences the welding process and the appearance
  of edge defects. Ultrasonic welding experiments with different layups and energy
  director configurations were carried out while monitoring temperatures at different
  locations inside and outside the weld overlap. The joints were characterized by
  single lap shear tests, analysis of corresponding fracture surfaces and microscopic
  cross-sections. Results showed that the anisotropic flow and the anisotropic thermal
  conductivity of the plies adjacent to the weld line have a distinct effect on the
  appearance and location of edge defects. By using energy directors that cover only
  part of the weld overlap area a new approach was developed to mitigate edge defects
  caused by the highly directional properties of the unidirectional plies.
