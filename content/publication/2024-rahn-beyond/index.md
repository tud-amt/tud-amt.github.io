abstract: As the aviation industry strives to minimise its environmental footprint,
  understanding the full life cycle impacts, including maintenance, becomes essential
  for sustainable development. This paper addresses the critical research gap in the
  environmental assessment of aircraft maintenance by conducting a comprehensive life
  cycle assessment based on an Airbus A320 aircraft. By combining a top-down check-level
  analysis and a detailed examination of the aircraft manufacturerâ€™s maintenance planning
  document, this study provides significant insights into the environmental implications
  of maintenance activities. The check-level analysis provides a general overview,
  while the analysis of the maintenance planning document delves into individual tasks,
  enabling the identification of components with the highest ecological impacts. This
  research emphasises the importance of including aircraft maintenance activities
  in life cycle assessment studies and provides valuable guidance for researchers,
  industry practitioners, and policy makers in prioritising sustainability measures
  and enhancing the environmental performance of aircraft throughout their life cycle.
