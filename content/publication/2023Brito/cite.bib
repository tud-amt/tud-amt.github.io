 abstract = {This paper evaluates the potential of changing the welding force and the compliance of the energy director (ED) to reduce the effects caused by misaligned adherends, which were: increased through-thickness heating, reduced size of welded area and increased heating time. In the methodology that was followed, we welded adherends misaligned by approximately 4.5Â° in different scenarios: with higher welding force; with increased ED compliance by the use of a thicker ED and; with increased ED compliance by the use of a discontinuous ED. The most significant reduction of the effects caused by misaligned adherends was obtained when combining the use of both increased welding force and discontinuous ED. Such improvement derives from the imposed parallelism caused by the use of a higher welding force and from a more efficient concentration of heat generation at the weld line that occurs when a discontinuous ED is used.},
