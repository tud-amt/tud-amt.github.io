abstract: 'This paper evaluates the potential of changing the welding force and the
  compliance of the energy director (ED) to reduce the effects caused by misaligned
  adherends, which were: increased through-thickness heating, reduced size of welded
  area and increased heating time. In the methodology that was followed, we welded
  adherends misaligned by approximately 4.5Â° in different scenarios: with higher welding
  force; with increased ED compliance by the use of a thicker ED and; with increased
  ED compliance by the use of a discontinuous ED. The most significant reduction of
  the effects caused by misaligned adherends was obtained when combining the use of
  both increased welding force and discontinuous ED. Such improvement derives from
  the imposed parallelism caused by the use of a higher welding force and from a more
  efficient concentration of heat generation at the weld line that occurs when a discontinuous
  ED is used.'
