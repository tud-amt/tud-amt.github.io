abstract: textlessptextgreaterAs the aviation industry strives to minimise its environmental
  footprint, understanding the full life cycle impacts, including maintenance, becomes
  essential for sustainable development. This paper addresses the critical research
  gap in the environmental assessment of aircraft maintenance by conducting a comprehensive
  life cycle assessment based on an Airbus A320 aircraft. By combining a top-down
  check-level analysis and a detailed examination of the aircraft manufacturer's maintenance
  planning document, this study provides significant insights into the environmental
  implications of maintenance activities. The check-level analysis provides a general
  overview, while the analysis of the maintenance planning document delves into individual
  tasks, enabling the identification of components with the highest ecological impacts.
  This research emphasises the importance of including aircraft maintenance activities
  in life cycle assessment studies and provides valuable guidance for researchers,
  industry practitioners, and policy makers in prioritising sustainability measures
  and enhancing the environmental performance of aircraft throughout their life cycle.textless/ptextgreater
