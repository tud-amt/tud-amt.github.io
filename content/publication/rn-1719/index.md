abstract: Intimate contact development under LAFP-specific thermal and mechanical
  boundary conditions/interactions and the effect of process parameters are investigated.
  One-layer, unidirectional strips of CF/PEKK material were placed with different
  process parameters on a flat tool surface to create different intimate contact conditions.
  The concept of effective intimate contact, which is based on the resin content at
  the surface, is introduced and a methodology to measure it from surface micrographs
  is provided. Degree of effective intimate contact measured from the samples was
  compared with the existing intimate contact models. The temperature history in the
  compaction zone was estimated with a finite element model and pressure sensitive
  films were used to determine the compaction pressure. It is shown that in addition
  to the squeeze flow mechanism, which is the base for the current intimate contact
  models, through-thickness percolation flow of the resin needs to be considered to
  explain the effective intimate contact development.
