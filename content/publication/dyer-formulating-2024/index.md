abstract: The development of epoxy resin formulations from renewable feedstocks has
  been thoroughly explored in the chemical literature. A simple one-pot chemical reaction
  involving sustainable phenolic molecules and epichlorohydrin results in the production
  of renewable epoxy monomers. These monomers can be cured with amines or anhydrides
  to yield cross-linked thermosetting resins. Although a wide variety of recipes exist,
  there is a notable gap in the application of these sustainable resin formulations
  to engineering contexts. This gap is primarily due to the lack of comprehensive,
  standardized analyses of these resin recipes, which impede their potential use in
  advanced composite applications. In this study, we reveal a high-performance resin
  formulation utilizing epoxidized phloroglucinol derived from brown algae in combination
  with an aerospace-grade amine hardener. The resin processing and thermomechanical
  properties are investigated using ASTM standard tests including tensile strength,
  flexural strength, fracture toughness, and interlaminar shear strength. Given the
  detailed comparative analysis, the partially renewable resin recipe outperforms
  petroleum derived analogues.
