 abstract = {Ultrasonic welding of fibre-reinforced thermoplastics is a joining technology with high potential for short welding times and low energy consumption. While the majority of the current studies on continuous ultrasonic welding have so far focused on woven reinforcements, unidirectional materials are preferred for highly loaded aerospace components due to their better mechanical performance. Therefore, this paper investigates the influence and interdependence of the welding speed, amplitude, and energy director thickness on the weld quality of adherends made of unidirectional composites. The quality of the welded joints is assessed by a single-lap shear strength and fracture surface analysis complemented by the microscopic analysis of cross-sections and comparison to a co-consolidated reference. The results showed that the welding process is highly affected by changing welding speeds for a given amplitude. Furthermore, while lower amplitudes lead to significant scatter in the welding quality, higher amplitudes result in increased heating rates and a fully molten energy director even for high welding speeds. Nevertheless, insufficient consolidation at high welding speeds results in porosity in the weld line. Finally, it was observed that thicker, and therefore more compliant, energy directors lead to more uniform melting of the energy director and less deviation in the weld quality for a wider range of welding speeds.},
