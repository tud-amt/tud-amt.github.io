abstract: AbstractThe unique sensing features of the tilted Fibre Bragg Grating (TFBG)
  as a single three-parameter optical sensor are demonstrated in this work, to monitor
  the manufacturing process of composite materials produced using Vacuum Assisted
  Resin Transfer Moulding (VARTM) process. Each TFBG sensor can measure simultaneously
  and separately strain, temperature and refractive index (RI) of the material where
  the optical fibre is embedded. A TFBG embedded in a 2?mm glass-fibre/epoxy composite
  plate was used to measure the thermomechanical variations induced during the curing
  process. At the same time, the RI measurements, performed with the same TFBG sensor,
  can estimate the degree of cure of the resin. The TFBG sensor shows to be a valid
  and promising technology to improve the state of art of sensing and monitoring in
  composite material manufacturing.
