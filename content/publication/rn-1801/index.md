abstract: A new model is proposed for the consolidation of hybrid textiles, in which
  air entrapment and dissolution are considered. One of the key parameters is tow
  permeability, which is described by the analytical model of Gebart and validated
  at very high fibre volume fractions by direct tow permeability measurement. The
  model also takes into account the presence of fibres limiting gas diffusion in the
  molten polymer. Experimental validation of the proposed model is then conducted
  with quasi-unidirectional glass textile and either polypropylene or polyethylene
  by measuring the impregnation degree as a function of the consolidation time. Good
  agreement is found between predictions and measurements for the two matrix systems
  at different pressures. It is shown that entrapped air significantly influences
  impregnation. The model offers new and comprehensive insights about the phenomena
  taking place during consolidation and enables future process optimization.
